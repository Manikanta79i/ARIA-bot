There are so many amazing PS4 games out there. But if I had to pick one, I'd say \"The Last of Us Remastered\" is a must-play. The storytelling, characters, and gameplay are all top-notch. It's an emotional rollercoaster that'll keep you hooked from start to finish.\n\nThat being said, if you're looking for something a bit different, you might enjoy \"God of War\" (2018) or \"Horizon Zero Dawn\". Both are action-adventure games with incredible graphics and engaging stories.\n\nWhat type of games are you into? Action, adventure, sports, or something else?"},{"role":"user","content":"Game like cod"},{"role":"assistant","content":"If you like Call of Duty (COD), you might enjoy other first-person shooter games.
